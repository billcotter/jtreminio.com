                <p>
                    I am a Texas-based web developer with a strong focus on PHP and the LAMP stack. As you can tell,
                    I have a fascination with testable code. If you are looking for an experienced developer to
                    create a new application, write new features into an existing application, or help you make
                    your application better by creating tests or refactoring the code then we should get in touch!

                    tested code brings to the table!
