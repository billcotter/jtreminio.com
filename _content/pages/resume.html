            <p>
                I am a Texas-based web developer with a strong focus on PHP and the LAMP stack. As you can tell,
                I have a fascination with testable code. If you are looking for an experienced developer to
                create a new application, write new features into an existing application, or help you make
                your application better by creating tests or refactoring the code then we should get in touch!
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been developing websites and applications for over a decade, starting with a humble person blog
                to a large, enterprise-level learning management system (LMS).
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a big advocate of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and unit testing in general. My ideal day is
                creating awesome code that comes fully vetted by tests!
            </p>

            <p>
                I have given a presentation to my local user group on unit testing, as well as written a series of
                tutorials.
            </p>

            <p>
                This fascination with testing stems from the significant boost in cofidence in the code I
                write, knowing it has been vetted and will continue to work as intended after further updates in the
                future.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to unit tests I am also a huge proponent of integration and behavorial testing - different
                techniques that simply even more confidence and vetting to my code.
